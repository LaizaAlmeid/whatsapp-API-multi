# Whatsapp API Tutorial

Hi, this is the implementation example of <a href="https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js">whatsapp-web.js</a>

## Important thing!

As because Whatsapp regularly makes an update, so we needs to always **use the latest version of whatsapp-web.js**. Some errors may occurs with the old versions, so please try to update the library version before creating an issue.

- Enter to the project directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start:dev`
- Open browser and go to address `http://localhost:8000`
- Scan the QR Code
